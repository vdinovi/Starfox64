### 11/19 - 7:34 pm
* Mesh files used were obtained from [models-resource](https://www.models-resource.com/nintendo_64/starfox64/)
* Had to spend more time than I'd like to admit figuring how mtl files work and extending *Shape* to load in material files as well.
* Not sure how to render environment. I can't seem to find any meshes online. I'd imagine its **not** a skybox. I might start off creating some elongated surface in maya and just tile them as the game moves forward.
* Ended up chaning A LOT of the base code. Going pretty well so far.
